/**
 * A persistent per-browser visitor id.
 *
 * Sessions rotate after 30 minutes idle (see `session.ts`), which makes them
 * useless for "how many people visited" — every long gap mints a new one. The
 * visitor id is the stable identifier that `uniq(VisitorId)` counts, and the
 * only place that knows whether a visitor is new (a self-join against earlier
 * sessions is both a second full scan and wrong past the warehouse's 30-day
 * TTL, which drops the history the join would need).
 *
 * This is a first-party persistent identifier: it requires a cookie/consent
 * notice under ePrivacy, and it is the one thing here that `persistVisitorId:
 * false` and Global Privacy Control turn off.
 *
 * ## Why two stores
 *
 * The id lives in **both** localStorage and a cookie, the same hybrid posthog-js
 * uses for its `localStorage+cookie` persistence:
 *
 * - localStorage is the durable copy. Safari's ITP caps the lifetime of any
 *   cookie set from `document.cookie` at 7 days, so a cookie alone would silently
 *   turn returning visitors into new ones every week.
 * - The cookie is the *cross-subdomain carrier*. localStorage is origin-scoped,
 *   so a marketing site on `example.com` and an app on `app.example.com` can
 *   never see each other's id; a cookie scoped to the registered domain can.
 *   That is what links an anonymous pre-signup visit to the account it becomes.
 *
 * Reads prefer the cookie and mirror the winner back, so an existing
 * localStorage-only visitor converges onto the shared id instead of being reset.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately *not* shared
 *
 * The **session** id stays origin-scoped (sessionStorage, `session.ts`). Unlike
 * PostHog, our `session_replays` table is a ReplacingMergeTree keyed
 * `(OrgId, SessionId)` whose fields resolve by `argMax(field, Version)` over the
 * whole row — two origins posting different ServiceName/EntryPath under one
 * session id would overwrite each other rather than merge. Sessions stay
 * per-surface; `VisitorId` is the join key between them.
