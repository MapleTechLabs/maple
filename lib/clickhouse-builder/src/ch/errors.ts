// Their own module because both `expr.ts` (literal encoding) and `compile.ts`
// (param resolution, orderBy validation) raise them, and `expr → compile` would
// close the `expr → compile → query → expr` cycle. That cycle survives today
// only because everything crossing it is a hoisted `function` declaration —
// one top-level `const` away from a TDZ crash in the bundle.

/**
 * Failures the builder reports, as opposed to defects it dies on.
 *
 * The line between the two is what a runtime value can reach:
 *
 * - A `QueryBuilderError` describes a **value** the builder was handed and
 *   cannot turn into SQL — a param with no value or the wrong type, an operand
 *   a column's codec rejects, a set of arguments whose *size* came from data (a
 *   funnel with no steps), a pattern string that would break out of its quotes.
 *   Code that assembles a query from a request body can hit every one of these
 *   with correct code and bad input, so they belong in the Effect error
 *   channel: `compile` turns a thrown one into a typed failure.
 *
 * - A {@link QueryBuilderDefect} describes a **call** that could not be right
 *   for any value — a query with no `select()`, an `orderBy` entry that is not
 *   a tuple, a param name that is not an identifier, a placeholder compared as
 *   if it were already resolved, two column types claiming one ClickHouse type
 *   name. No input reaches these; only a rewrite does. They stay defects, so
 *   nobody pattern-matches on a bug.
 *
 * Which class a case belongs to is not a matter of how bad it looks: it is
 * whether a request body could produce it. `select()` and `orderBy` are written
 * in the source of a query definition and cannot be steered by a value, so they
 * are defects however loudly they fail.
