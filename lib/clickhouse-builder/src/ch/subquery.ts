// The three conditions above put a subquery where SQL expects a subquery. These
// put its *SQL text* somewhere the builder has no syntax for — inside an
// aggregate, a CTE reference, a tuple comparison — which is a real need and the
// reason `compileCHUnsafe` used to be called from query-definition code.
//
// Doing that eagerly is the problem: a query definition that compiles an inner
// query is running the compiler outside the `Effect` its own `compile` will run
// in, so an unencodable value handed to the inner query throws synchronously
// from the *builder*. Both constructors below defer the inner compile to the
// outer one, which is what puts the failure back in the error channel.

/**
 * An inner query's SQL spliced into an expression, compiled with the outer
 * query.
 *
 * `wrap` receives the inner SQL and returns the expression text — it is where
 * the aggregate or subquery syntax the builder cannot express goes. It runs
 * during the outer `compile`, so a `QueryBuilderError` raised by the inner
 * query surfaces as the outer compilation's typed failure.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const cutoff = subqueryExpr(cheapScan, T.dateTimeString, (sql) => `(SELECT min(ts) FROM (${sql}))`)
 * ```
 *
 * Params are deferred: placeholders inside the spliced SQL are resolved by the
 * outer query's substitution pass, with the outer params.
 *
 * Use the result inside a `select`/`where`/`having` callback, which is where the
 * deferral pays off. Comparison and arithmetic methods render their operand
 * eagerly, so combining one of these into a `Condition` at module scope —
 * `const c = $.Ts.gte(subqueryExpr(inner, T.dateTime))` outside a callback —
 * compiles the inner query there, which is the throw this exists to avoid.
