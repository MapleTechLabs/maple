# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

First public release.

- Type-safe table definitions, immutable query builder, joins, subqueries,
  unions, and CTEs.
- Parameterised compilation: `param.string` / `int` / `float` / `bool` /
  `dateTime`. Values are checked against the declared kind at compile time — a
  param with no value, a `Date` where a string was declared, or a fraction where
  an integer was, throws `QueryBuilderError` instead of becoming SQL text.
- Optional per-table tenant scoping: declare `{ tenantColumn }` on a table and
  every compiled query reports whether it pinned a single tenant. Reported,
  never enforced; tables that declare nothing compile `"untenanted"`.
- `route(tag)` carries an opaque execution tag through to the compiled query
  as a type-level fact.
- Schema-first column types: `T.uint64` and friends are Effect `Schema`s, not
  phantom tags, so `compile` derives each query's row schema from its SELECT and
  `decodeRows` validates without a hand-written schema. `rowSchemaSource` says
  whether it was `"derived"`, `"declared"`, or `"none"` (some selected
  expression had no type to read). A declared schema still wins, and can narrow.
- Wire quirks modelled once in the types: 64-bit integers accept ClickHouse's
  quoted form and Tinybird's bare numbers; `T.dateTime` parses the tz-less
  `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss` shape as UTC into a `DateTime.Utc`, with
  `T.dateTimeString` for consumers that need the string exactly as sent.
- The encode direction of those same schemas writes every literal: comparing a
  column against a value encodes it through the column's type, so a `Map` writes
  as `map('k', 'v')`, an `Array` as `['a', 'b']`, a `Bool` as `1`/`0`, and a
  value the column cannot hold fails while the SQL is being built. Params
  resolve through the same path, and `param.of(type, name)` accepts any column
  type — including one declared with `T.custom(sql, schema)`.
- Compilation is Effect-returning. `compile` / `compileUnion` fail with a typed
  `QueryBuilderError` — a missing param value, a value the column cannot encode —
  instead of throwing, so a caller can handle one rather than crash. A throw that
  is not a `QueryBuilderError` stays a defect: it is a bug, not a condition.
  `compileUnsafe` / `compileUnionUnsafe` keep the throwing behaviour for fixtures
  and catalogs, where failing loudly is the contract.
- Schema-checked row decoding (`decodeRows` / `decodeFirstRow`). No `castRows`.
  When nothing could be derived, `untypedColumns` names the selected aliases
  responsible, so "this query decodes nothing" is not a dead end.
- `encodeRows` runs the row schema backwards, turning decoded rows into the wire
  shape ClickHouse sent. A service can hold the value worth computing with and
  still emit the exact bytes its own clients parse, rather than choosing.
- Every expression the package produces carries its type. Literals, the
  arithmetic operators, `Map` subscripts (`$.Attrs.get(k)` decodes as the map's
  value type), and every wrapped function declare what they return, so a query
  built from typed pieces derives a schema for the whole row rather than losing
  it to one untyped field.
- The escape hatches say so in their names. `rawExpr(sql, type)` requires the
  column type its SQL produces; `untypedExpr(sql)` is the version with no type,
  and `defineUntypedFn` the same for functions. `defineFn`'s result type is
  required, and may be a rule reading the type off the arguments — `sameAs(i)`,
  `firstTyped()`, `elementOf(i)`, `arrayOfArg(i)` — for the many ClickHouse
  functions that hand back one of their inputs.
- `T.aggregateState(fn, …args)` names an `AggregateFunction` state column: an
  opaque value an outer `-Merge` reads, never a row anyone decodes. Declaring
  one no longer costs its query the rest of its row schema.
- `T.int64`, and `arraySort` / `arrayReverseSort` / `arrayDistinct` /
  `arrayPushFront` / `arrayElement` / `hex` join the wrapped catalog.
- Requires Effect 4 (`effect@rc`) as a peer dependency.
