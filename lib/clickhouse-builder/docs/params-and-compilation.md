# Params and compilation

## Declaring params

```ts
CH.param.string("orgId")
CH.param.int("limit")
CH.param.float("threshold")
CH.param.bool("includeDrafts")
CH.param.dateTime("startTime")
```

Those five are the whole set. A param is an `Expr` placeholder usable anywhere an expression
is — most often on the right of a comparison:

```ts
.where(($) => [$.OrgId.eq(CH.param.string("orgId"))])
```

Calling a comparison method **on** an unresolved param (rather than passing it as an argument)
throws `QueryBuilderDefect`: there is nothing to compare yet, and which side of the comparison the
param sits on is written in the source, so no input can cause or avoid it. See
[Failures and defects](#failures-and-defects).

Param names must be alphanumeric, optionally separated by single underscores — the name travels
through the placeholder that `compile` later matches, and `__` would make its boundary
ambiguous. A name that cannot round-trip is a `QueryBuilderDefect` at declaration.

## What each kind accepts

The declared kind is checked when the value arrives, so a value of the wrong shape is a
compilation failure rather than SQL text that happens to contain it:

| Kind       | Accepts                                                | Emits                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `string`   | a string                                               | an escaped literal, `'org_123'` |
| `int`      | a safe integer                                         | `50`                            |
| `float`    | any finite number                                      | `0.95`                          |
| `bool`     | a boolean                                              | `1` / `0`                       |
| `dateTime` | `'YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss'`, a `Date`, or a `DateTime.Utc` | `'2026-01-01 00:00:00'`         |

Each kind names a column type, and the value is encoded through that type's
schema — the same schema a column of that type decodes rows with, read backwards. The two
directions cannot drift, because there is only one of them.

`param.dateTime` and `param.dateTimeString` preserve milliseconds in `Date` and `DateTime.Utc`
values, as well as fractions already present in strings. Use `param.dateTimeSeconds` for a
whole-second DateTime bound, or `param.of(T.dateTime, name)` for the parsed UTC flavour.

`param.of` keeps each codec distinct even when several types share the same SQL name.
Reuse type definitions across queries when practical.

`param.of(type, name)` takes it further: any column type, including one you declared with
`T.custom`, works as a param.

```ts
const Level = T.custom("Enum8", Schema.Literals(["warn", "error"]))

CH.from(Events)
	.select(($) => ({ n: CH.count() }))
	.where(($) => [$.Level.eq(CH.param.of(Level, "level"))])

yield * CH.compile(query, { level: "warn" }) // … WHERE Level = 'warn'
yield * CH.compile(query, { level: "banana" }) // fails — the schema rejected it
```

Compilation returns an `Effect`, so a value the query cannot accept is a typed failure rather
than a throw. That matters because these are runtime values: a param bag comes from a request
as often as from your own code, and a route that can `catchTag` a bad one can answer with a
400 instead of crashing.

```ts
yield * CH.compile(query, { startTime: new Date("2026-01-01T00:00:00Z") })
// … WHERE Timestamp >= '2026-01-01 00:00:00'

yield * CH.compile(query, { limit: 10.5 })
// fails with QueryBuilderError { code: "InvalidLiteral" } — use param.float for fractions

yield * CH.compile(query, {})
// fails with QueryBuilderError { code: "UnresolvedParam" }: no value given for param 'orgId'
```

A throw that is _not_ a `QueryBuilderError` — a bug inside one of your callbacks — stays a
defect. Turning it into a typed failure would hand you a value to pattern-match on where the
honest answer is that something is broken.

`compileUnsafe` (and `compileUnionUnsafe`) throw instead, for the places where that is the
contract: a fixture or a catalog sweep should fail loudly rather than produce an entry nobody
notices is missing.

Params the query never mentions are ignored, so one bag of params can serve a family of
queries.

## How params are resolved

> **Params are resolved at compile time, not execution time.** `compile` substitutes each
> value into the SQL text. This is _not_ server-side parameter binding — ClickHouse never sees
> a placeholder.

```ts
const compiled = CH.compileUnsafe(query, { orgId: "org_123" })
compiled.sql // … WHERE OrgId = 'org_123'
```

Two consequences worth planning around:

- **Every distinct parameter set produces a distinct SQL string.** If you cache or fingerprint
  by SQL text, each value is its own entry.
- **Escaping is the safety mechanism**, not binding. String values go through
  `escapeClickHouseString`, which escapes backslashes and single quotes:

    ```ts
    CH.compileUnsafe(query, { orgId: "a'b\\c" })
    // … WHERE OrgId = 'a\'b\\c'
    ```

    Values flowing through `param.*` and the comparison methods are escaped. Values you splice
    in via [`rawExpr` / `rawCond`](./extending.md#raw-escape-hatches) are **not** — never build
    those from user input.

A query is a reusable template: compile the same one repeatedly with different params.

## `compile`

```ts
CH.compile(query, params, options?)   // Effect<CompiledQuery, QueryBuilderError>
CH.compileUnsafe(query, params, options?)  // CompiledQuery, throws
```

| Argument              | Meaning                                                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `query`               | The `CHQuery` to compile                                             |
| `params`              | Record resolving every `param.*` placeholder by name                 |
| `options.rowSchema`   | Effect `Schema` used by `decodeRows` / `decodeFirstRow`              |
| `options.skipFormat`  | Omit a trailing `FORMAT` clause (used internally for subqueries)     |
| `options.deferParams` | Leave placeholders unresolved, for SQL spliced into an outer compile |

`compileCH` is the internal name; the package exports it as `compile`. Unions use
`compileUnion(union, params)`.

## The `CompiledQuery`

```ts
interface CompiledQuery<Output> {
	readonly sql: string
	readonly tenantScope: "single-tenant" | "cross-tenant"
	readonly rowSchemaSource: "declared" | "derived" | "none"
	readonly rowSchema: CompiledQueryRowSchema<Output> | undefined
	readonly untypedColumns: ReadonlyArray<string>
	readonly rowSchemaMismatch: RowSchemaMismatch | undefined
	readonly rawSql?: { readonly reason: string; readonly justification: string }
	readonly route?: string
	readonly decodeRows: (rows) => Effect<ReadonlyArray<Output>, CompiledQueryDecodeError>
	readonly decodeFirstRow: (rows) => Effect<Option<Output>, CompiledQueryDecodeError>
	readonly encodeRows: (rows) => Effect<ReadonlyArray<Record<string, unknown>>, CompiledQueryEncodeError>
}
```

| Field                           | Purpose                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sql`                           | The statement to execute. The builder never runs it.                                     |
| `tenantScope`                   | Whether the query pins a single tenant — see [Tenant scoping](./tenant-scoping.md)       |
| `rowSchemaSource`               | Where the row schema came from, so a caller can tell real validation from a pass-through |
| `rowSchema`                     | The codec itself, for a caller that needs a `Schema` rather than a call                  |
| `untypedColumns`                | When `rowSchemaSource` is `"none"`, the selected aliases responsible                     |
| `rowSchemaMismatch`             | How a _declared_ schema disagrees with the SELECT by field name, when it does            |
| `rawSql`                        | Present only for `rawCompiledQuery`: the `reason` and `note` it was given                |
| `route`                         | Set by `.route(tag)`; opaque metadata for your executor                                  |
| `decodeRows` / `decodeFirstRow` | See [Decoding results](./decoding-results.md)                                            |
| `encodeRows`                    | The same codec backwards — decoded rows to the wire shape                                |

There is deliberately **no `castRows`**. A bare cast looked type-safe while hiding wire-format
drift, so it was removed in favour of schema-checked decoding.

## Handwritten SQL

When you need SQL the builder cannot express, `rawCompiledQuery` wraps a string in the same
`CompiledQuery` interface so downstream code is uniform. `tenantScope` is required there,
because it cannot be inferred from a string. See [Extending the DSL](./extending.md).

## Failures and defects

Two classes, and the line between them is what a runtime value can reach.

`QueryBuilderError` describes a **value** the builder was handed and cannot turn into SQL. Code
that assembles a query from a request body can hit every one of these with correct code and bad
input, so `compile` puts them in the Effect error channel, catchable by the tag
`"@maple-dev/clickhouse-builder/QueryBuilderError"`:

| Code               | Cause                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `UnresolvedParam`  | A param the params bag has no value for                                  |
| `InvalidLiteral`   | A param value, or a comparison operand, the column's codec rejects       |
| `InvalidArguments` | Arguments a function cannot use — an empty condition list, a bad pattern |

`QueryBuilderDefect` describes a **call** that could not be right for any value: a query with no
`select()`, an `orderBy` entry that is not a tuple, a param name that is not an identifier, a
placeholder compared as if it were resolved, two column types claiming one ClickHouse type name.
No input reaches these; only a rewrite does — a missing `select()` is written in the query
definition, not steered by a request. `compile` maps
only `QueryBuilderError` into the error channel and dies on everything else, so a defect arrives
as a defect in the `Cause` — where a bug belongs, and where no `catchTag` can swallow it.
