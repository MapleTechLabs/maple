/**
 * The planning pass: scope the incident, then say what is worth testing.
 *
 * Runs on the strong model — the same one the validator gets, not the cheaper
 * one the lanes get. One pass decides how the entire run is spent: a planner
 * that writes a hypothesis with no evidence source burns a whole lane, and a
 * planner that misses the real angle means no lane ever looks at it. That is the
 * highest-leverage model call in the flow, so it is the one that should not be
 * economised on.
