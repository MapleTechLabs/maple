## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- 737e082: Raw HTTP client spans no longer open error issues for failures the caller already handled. A 4xx client span keeps its `Error` status but no longer carries an `exception` event, so error tracking leaves the issue to the caller's span: one that does not handle the 4xx still fails and reports it. In the browser preset, a request that fails in transport while the page was hidden, unloading or offline exports as `Unset` with the reason in `maple.connection_lost`.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- ed8a412: A 5xx server span keeps its `HttpServerErrorResponse` exception on Effect 4.0.2 and later, which now fails the span itself with an `HttpServerError` for any 5xx response. Without this, those responses were grouped as one generic `HttpServerError` issue.
