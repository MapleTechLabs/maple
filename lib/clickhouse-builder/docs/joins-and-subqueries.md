# Joins and subqueries

## Joining a table

Each join takes the table, an alias, and an ON callback receiving both sides:

```ts
const query = CH.from(Events, "e")
	.innerJoin(Services, "s", (main, joined) => main.Name.eq(joined.Name))
	.select(($) => ({ name: $.Name, team: $.s.Team }))
	.where(($) => [$.OrgId.eq("org_123")])

// SELECT e.Name AS name, s.Team AS team
// FROM events AS e
// INNER JOIN services AS s ON e.Name = s.Name
// WHERE e.OrgId = 'org_123'
```

Once a join exists, the accessor gains a key per alias. Main-table columns stay at the top
level (`$.Name`), joined columns sit under their alias (`$.s.Team`). Alias the main table in
`from()` so its references qualify too.

Available: `innerJoin`, `leftJoin`, `crossJoin` (which takes no ON callback).

_(Backed by `docs/joins-and-subqueries.md > Joining a table`.)_

### `leftJoin` nullability

`leftJoin` wraps the joined side in `NullableColumnDefs`, so its columns infer as `T | null`
in the output row. Derived codecs accept NULL when `join_use_nulls=1` and the column
defaults ClickHouse emits with `join_use_nulls=0`. This applies to `leftJoinQuery` too.
An explicitly declared `rowSchema` must also accept the nullable joined columns.

## Joining a subquery

`innerJoinQuery`, `leftJoinQuery`, and `crossJoinQuery` take a `CHQuery` instead of a table.
The inner query's **output** shape becomes the joined column set, so aliases you selected are
what you join on:

```ts
const perTeam = CH.from(Services)
	.select(($) => ({ name: $.Name, team: $.Team }))
	.where(($) => [$.OrgId.eq("org_123")])

CH.from(Events, "e")
	.innerJoinQuery(perTeam, "s", (main, joined) => main.Name.eq(joined.name))
	.select(($) => ({ team: $.s.team }))
```

## Subquery in `FROM`

`fromQuery(query, alias)` starts a new query over another query's output:

```ts
const inner = CH.from(Events)
	.select(($) => ({ name: $.Name, ms: $.DurationMs }))
	.where(($) => [$.OrgId.eq("org_123")])

const outer = CH.fromQuery(inner, "sub")
	.select(($) => ({ name: $.name, worst: CH.max($.ms) }))
	.groupBy("name")

// SELECT name AS name, max(ms) AS worst
// FROM (SELECT Name AS name, DurationMs AS ms FROM events WHERE OrgId = 'org_123') AS sub
// GROUP BY name
```

> **Accessors are flat.** Inside the outer query the inner columns are `$.name` and `$.ms` —
> **not** `$.sub.name`. The alias names the derived table in SQL; it does not namespace the
> accessor. Reaching for `$.sub.name` throws at runtime.

The outer query inherits the inner query's tenant scope: a scoped subquery cannot leak other
tenants' rows, so the outer stays `"single-tenant"` even with no WHERE of its own. See
[Tenant scoping](./tenant-scoping.md).

_(Backed by `docs/joins-and-subqueries.md > Subquery in FROM uses flat accessors` and
`> A scoped subquery keeps the outer query scoped`.)_

## Subquery conditions

- `inSubquery(expr, subquery)` → `expr IN (…)`
- `notInSubquery(expr, subquery)` → `expr NOT IN (…)`, i.e. an anti-join as a predicate
- `exists(subquery)` → `EXISTS (…)`
- `outerRef<T>(name)` — reference an outer column from inside the inner query, e.g.
  `outerRef("e.TraceId")`

Pass the **query itself**. It is compiled where it is spliced, so its params, table names and
column types stay checked:

```ts
const excluded = CH.from(Events)
	.select(($) => ({ n: $.Name }))
	.where(($) => [$.OrgId.eq(param.string("orgId"))])

const query = CH.from(Services, "s")
	.select(($) => ({ team: $.Team }))
	.where(($) => [$.OrgId.eq(param.string("orgId")), CH.notInSubquery($.Team, excluded)])

const compiled = CH.compileUnsafe(query, { orgId: "org_123" })
// … WHERE OrgId = 'org_123' AND Team NOT IN (SELECT Name AS n FROM events WHERE OrgId = 'org_123')
```

Params inside the subquery resolve from the **outer** param set: placeholders survive the splice
and are substituted in one pass at the end, so `orgId` above is passed once and reaches both.

For correlated subqueries, `outerRef` names a column of the enclosing query:

```ts
const inner = CH.from(Events)
	.select(($) => ({ n: $.Name }))
	.where(($) => [$.OrgId.eq("org_123"), $.Name.eq(CH.outerRef("s.Name"))])

CH.from(Services, "s")
	.select(($) => ({ team: $.Team }))
	.where(($) => [$.OrgId.eq("org_123"), CH.exists(inner)])
```

All three also accept a pre-compiled SQL string, for the rare case where that is all you have.

> **A subquery never scopes its outer query.** `WHERE x IN (SELECT y FROM t WHERE OrgId = 'a')`
> does not confine the outer read to org `a` — nothing stops org `b` holding the same `y`. The
> outer query still needs its own tenant predicate, or a row source that is itself scoped. This
> is true whether you pass a query or a string.

> **`NOT IN` and NULLs.** If the subquery yields any NULL, `NOT IN` is never true. Project a
> non-nullable column, or filter the NULLs out inside the subquery.

## Splicing a subquery where there is no syntax for one

`exists` / `inSubquery` / `notInSubquery` put a subquery where SQL expects a subquery. Sometimes
you need its _SQL text_ somewhere the builder has no syntax for — inside an aggregate, a tuple
comparison, a hand-written predicate:

```sql
Timestamp >= (SELECT min(ts) FROM (<a cheap scan>))
```

That is what `subqueryExpr` is for. It takes the inner query, the column type its result decodes
as, and a `wrap` function that receives the inner SQL and returns the expression text:

```ts
import { subqueryCond, subqueryExpr } from "@maple-dev/clickhouse-builder"

// Stage 1: a cheap scan reading only the sort column.
const cheapScan = CH.from(Events)
	.select(($) => ({ ts: $.Timestamp }))
	.where(($) => [$.OrgId.eq(param.string("orgId"))])
	.orderBy(["ts", "desc"])
	.limit(100)

const cutoff = subqueryExpr(cheapScan, T.dateTime, (sql) => `(SELECT min(ts) FROM (${sql}))`)

// Stage 2: the heavy columns, read only for rows at or after the cutoff.
const query = CH.from(Events)
	.select(($) => ({ name: $.Name, attrs: $.Attributes }))
	.where(($) => [$.OrgId.eq(param.string("orgId")), $.Timestamp.gte(cutoff)])
```

`subqueryCond` is the same thing as a predicate, and `untypedSubqueryExpr` the same thing for a
value that never becomes a row (which costs the query its row schema — see
[Decoding results](./decoding-results.md)):

```ts
CH.from(Events)
	.select(($) => ({ name: $.Name }))
	.where(($) => [
		$.OrgId.eq(param.string("orgId")),
		subqueryCond(cheapScan, (sql) => `Timestamp IN (SELECT ts FROM (${sql}))`),
	])
```

**The inner query is compiled by the outer `compile`, not when you build the expression.** That
is the whole point of these three, and the reason not to reach for `compileUnsafe(inner).sql` and
a template string of your own:

- Params inside the spliced SQL resolve from the **outer** param set, in the same single
  substitution pass as everything else — exactly like the subquery conditions above.
- A value the inner query cannot encode fails the **outer** compile, so it lands in the error
  channel where a route can `catchTag` it. Compiling the inner query yourself runs the compiler
  while the outer query is still being _built_ — outside any `Effect` — so the same bad value is
  a synchronous throw from your query-definition function instead.

You are assembling SQL text inside `wrap`: interpolate only values you control, and route
anything user-supplied through `str()` from the `/sql` subpath so it gets escaped.

## Membership helpers

- `inList(expr, values)` — `expr IN ('a', 'b')` for a string list
- `inExprList(expr, exprs)` — same, for expression lists
- `notInList(expr, values)` — available from the `/expr` subpath

These predate `.in_()` and remain useful when you have an array in hand rather than varargs.
